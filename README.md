# WS21

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/5972cb11-ad25-47bc-8e28-31fe814285df/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/confident-swanson-1459e9/deploys)

This is the repository we started to fill as part of our winter semester course in 2021 at [FH St.Poelten](https://www.fhstp.ac.at/en/academic-studies-continuing-education/media-digital-technologies/creative-computing)

### Here are folders you'll find

- `app` -- Here you'll find the main Vite App we built
- `reduce` -- A little example about reducing and transforming a dataset
- `tower` -- A small fun example to build a tower

### What should be in the App

To start the app switch to the `app` folder and run `npm install` to get all dependencies.
Then you can call `npm run dev` to run the dev server and have the application running.

The Application should have

- The calculator (we built an original version)
- A Pokedex
- A cardgame that's fun to play with

### How to Submit the Project

We'll deploy the Site to [Netlify](https://netlify.com) in one simple step.

1. Create New Project
1. Link to Git Repository
1. Configure project:
   - `base dir: app`
   - `build command: npm run build`
   - `build dir: app/dist`

Now your page should be deployed and available under a simple [random domain](https://confident-swanson-1459e9.netlify.app/guesser).

Once that is all running go to the [issues](https://gitlab.com/codebryo/ws21/-/issues) page on this project, create a new Issue with title: `Project YOUR NAME`

Add a link to the running project site, and once I had a look at it I will close the Issue.
